Preheat oven to 350 degrees

In a skillet, melt 1/2 teaspoon of butter and add the red onion. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Set the onion aside.

Place 2 slices of bread on your work surface. Top each with an equal amount of cheese. Top with the onions and place the remaining bread slices on top.

Put 1 tablespoon butter in your skillet and cook on low heat to brown the butter. Be sure not to burn the butter.

Add the sandwiches and cook until browned and toasty on the first side, about 1 1/2 minutes.

Flip the sandwiches and cook for less than a minute.

Remove the sandwiches from the skillet and place on a baking sheet. Spread the remaining butter on the sandwiches and place in the oven for 4 minutes, until everything is melted through.
